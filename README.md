# guess-game

Just a basic React Native Project. First you enter a number and confirm/reset that.
On reset, the number will disappear and you can enter again and on confirm we move to the next screen where the computer guesses your number based on the algo of generating a random number.
Now you need to direct the computer whether the guessed number is higher and lower. Remember you cannot give a wrong direction, an alert will be thrown.
The app stores all the attempts of the computer and shows in a list when the game is over(different screen) i.e. the computer guesses your number.

Used the concepts of flexbox in react native, basic layout patterns and components, totally built using react hooks.
UI libraries used: Paper UI.

Just a basic project tbh.
